    "## Exploring Data\n",
    "Now lets get some data to explore. Alain Desrosieres argues that the central tension in histories examining the roles of statistics in political discourse is that the statistical entities that statistics uses are both real and fabrications: real in that they must be taken as “uncontestable standards” of reference insofar as they serve as  compelling evidence for a particular claim; fabrications in that they are the result of “the provisional and fragile crowning of a series of conventions of equivalence between entities.”[1] The statistical entity of life expectancy, for instance, is real insofar as it serves as a proxy for the health of populations and individuals, and is used to justify disparities in health and life insurance pricing and coverage for different populations. Yet in calculating life expectancy, one quickly discovers not a single computational method, but hundreds--each with a different set of assumptions that yield different results. Deciding which life expectancy estimation to employ is tied up with what the measure will be used to do, and so involves political, ethical, and even moral decisions about who and what should be counted and excluded.[2] Tracing the historical transformation of a statistical entity from a contingent, context-sensitive description into a “universal” property provides insight into the political institutions that created it while also making legible the ways in which a statistical entity exerted a reciprocal pressure back upon the institutions and individuals that created them.[3] Exploring the political implications of statistical entities is further complicated by their historical tendency to be repurposed for use in new arguments. While life expectancy was first developed for assigning and categorizing individuals according to their likelihood of death while their life insurance policy was in force, this statistical category was subsequently put to more sinister purposes: namely, to “demonstrate” the existence of racial biological characteristics and then to serve as “evidence” that race was an appropriate category for screening immigrants.[4]\n",
