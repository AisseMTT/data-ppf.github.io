Part 1:
in-class presentation of lecture on NSA history


Part 2:
response/analysis of problems in headline/meme format

Put yourself into a group of 4-5 people.

You are (collectively) a thinkfluencer on twitter, weibo or Instagram and it’s time to thinkfluence your vast hoard of followers using materials and your thoughts from the class.

Collectively write (in a google doc or the like) a tweet storm of at least 6 tweets responding to a recent article. Examples you might use

“Poor People’s Privacy Can’t Be an Afterthought,” https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/opinion/privacy-poverty.html

“Facebook expects FTC fine could be as much as $5 billion” https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/tech/facebook-q1-earnings/index.html

“In the basement of CHOP, warehouse workers say they’re held to impossible quotas”  https://www.philly.com/news/warehouse-workers-quotas-rate-childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-canon-20190422.html

“Facial recognition creeps up on a JetBlue passenger and she hates it” https://www.zdnet.com/article/facial-recognition-creeps-up-on-a-jetblue-passenger-and-she-hates-it/

“Google Walkout Organizers Say They're Facing Retaliation” https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-say-theyre-facing-retaliation/

“Tech’s new stars have it all—except a path to high profits”

While your tweets can praise or denounce the articles, more important is to use the articles to instruct your minions using ideas and materials from the class.

Your tweets should include:

-    Some sort of more “technical” clarification or comment or link
-    Quotation of and commentary on some facet article (but don’t just summarize it . . .)
-    At least two links to some pieces of relevant writing to deepen the conversation
-    One meme or reaction gif
You need not

-    Include pictures of yourself with avocado toast with muted colors even if you would profit from product placement
-    Include A maximally clickbaity tweet
-    Subtweet various of your enemies


When you’re done put your tweets into one document and post in the #labs channel, with
-    your thinkfluencer name (e.g. WoKedAtA293)
-    the names of everyone in the group
