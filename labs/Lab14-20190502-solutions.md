"Ok, then you fix it” exercise:

Put yourself into a group of 4-5 people.

You are (collectively) someone or something capable of effecting some forms of change in response to major political, ethical, and/or scientific challenges around data and machine learning.

You might be a tech CEO, a venture capitalist, Congress, the head of the FTC, the head of the NSA, attorney general, the head of the ACLU, a community activist organization, or …..

You can give yourself as much power as you wish, but your answers may seem less plausible the more you make yourself omnipotent and omniscient.

Your group should:
1)    Identify what changemaker(s) you represent
2)    what is problem (name the dumpsterfire)
3)    why a problem / for whom
- role of ethics
- disparate impact
  + careful: problem for CEOs or for you?
4) identify goal (‘need’,‘should’)
- also check goal against 2, e.g.,
  + transfer of harms?
  + creates new ethical / legal problem? (e.g., tech solution to face recognition)
5)    Identify who the key “stakeholders” you need to convince/suborn/imprison
6)    A detailed 3-5 step plan to effect meaningful change by “deploying” your solution.

Be specific. Be be specific.

You group will post your brief manifesto on slack and time permitting briefly describe it in class.
