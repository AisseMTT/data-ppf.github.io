    ">THE Gladiator is certainly one of the most beautiful works of ancient sculpture. It is with reason that artists have studied its free and noble forms, and have often measured the principal dimensions of the head and of the body to obtain its proportions and its harmony. To measure a statue is not so easy an operation as might at first appear, particularly if it be desired to obtain very precise results. In measuring ten times in succession the circumference of the chest, we are not sure of finding two results identically the same. It almost always happens that the values obtained are more or less distant from that sought; and I even suppose the most favourable circumstances those where there is no tendency to make the measurements either too small or too great. If we had the courage to recommence a thousand times, we should in the end have a series of numbers differing from one another, according to the degree of precision exercised in their collection. The mean of all these numbers would certainly differ very little from the true value. \n"

The single act of respiration, which causes each instant a variation of the form and dimension of the chest, would add a powerful cause of error to those which concur in operating on a perfectly motionless statue. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, the thousand measurements grouped in order of magnitude would yet proceed in a most regular manner. The line which represents them would always be the curve of possibility, but dilated in a horizontal direction in proportion to the probable error.\n",

If such were not the law of nature, the measurements would not (spite of their imperfections) group themselves with the astonishing symmetry which the law of possibility assigns them. Of the admirable laws which Nature attaches to the preservation of the species, I think I may put in the first rank that of maintaining the type. In my work on *La Physique Sociale*, I have already endeavoured to determine this type by the knowledge of the human mean. But if I mistake not, what experiment and reasoning had shown me, here takes the character of a mathematical truth. The human type, for men of the same race, and of the same age, is so well established that the differences between the results of observation and of calculation, notwithstanding the numerous accidental causes which might induce or exaggerate them, scarcely exceed those which unskilfulness may produce in a series of measurements taken on one individual. \n",

Everything occurs then as though there existed a type of man, from which all other men differed more or less. Nature has placed before our eyes living examples of what theory shows us."
