    "\n",
    "In 1905 a New York Lawyer named Charles Evans Hughes put American corporations on trial: namely, the Big 5 insurances companies at the time had steadily raised salaries of high-ranking employees even as policyholder dividends continued to fall [1]. Hughes was tasked with running a state investigation colloquially known as the \"Armstrong investigation\" to find out why, and began interviewing some of the very people whose high salaries were being questioned. Particularly sensational to the reading public following this \"investigation\" was the discovery that insurance actuaries did not use the empirically observed number of deaths, expense account balances, or exact annual interests on investiments [2]. Instead insurance companies <b>calculated \"smoothed curves\" from data, arguing that such smoothed curves more accurately  described reality</b>. Here early 20th C actuaries were borrowing a page from early 19th C astronomers. For astronomers, the mean position of, say, the position of a star in the sky became its *real* position, even if the mean matched no particular observation, as long as the errors of observation could be assumed to be random. This was a kind of smoothing via least squares [3]. Perhaps this makes sense when observing an object in the sky, but did it make sense to treat errors as deviations: to smooth life expectancies, expense sheets, annual investiment interest and treat these as the \"correct\" values to calculate risk, make business decisions, and mail annuity payments? Many in life insurance thought it did. In fact, some in insurance saw smoothing as a way not merely to describe society and assign individual risk, but even as a means of improving society by attempting to decrease individual statistical risks, as can be seen in this plot in a book co-authored by Louis Dublin, a vice-president of MET Life Insurance Company in 1931 [4]:\n",
