Today we will make our own database of ruin.

If you consent, please DM me your uni. Terms of service are: I will use data that the Columbia LDAP gives from your UNI. this may include address, department, school

This will inform a database containing PII, which we will collaborate to make more anonymous/private, under two technical definitions 

1) k-anonymity
2) differential privacy
