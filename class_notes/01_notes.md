# data: ppf
# first day of class outline

- want to encourage "shoppers"

### initial activity

introduce class with *activity and discussion*, rather than a reading (say 30 minutes)

goals: 

1) data and its provence

e.g. Mor's data on twitter and foursquare during hurricane sandy
e.g. flu data
e.g. 


- get them to reflect on provenance and limitations of data sets in question
- procedures necessary to generate it and then to process it
- get them to suggest how work around limits of data set

2) algorithms and analysis

- this harder, or likely to divide class in various competencies

- generalize: get students to talk about the choices involved in any form of analysis, qualitative or quantitative
  (i.e. draw in students of all kinds)
    if get technical answer, help to explain affordances and limits of say some std algorithm
