Chapter 3 (U) Bush\'s Dream Does Not Come True

\(U) A Look Ahead to Peace

\(U) America\'s entry into the war led to the release of torrents of
money for codebreaking. A surprisingly large allocation was given to the
Bureau of Ships for cryptanalytic machine development. Unfortunately,
\"G\" and the bureau were not prepared, and they were unable to
immediately establish a well-coordinated project that could compensate
for the years of lost opportunities. The funds came too late to set up a
long-term development program, and \"G\'s\" resources had to be devoted
to cryptanalytic fire-fighting. Until very late in the war, OP-20-G\'s
computer activities were driven by emergencies. Until late 1943,
\"G\'s\" brilliant mathematicians and engineers did not even have the
time to think of machines that went beyond Bush\'s mid-i930s ideas or to
plan their move from analog to electronic digital technologies.

\(U) After they made their great electromechanical contribution to the
Ultra problem, the Bombe, they had more time. They built a few
path-breaking digital electronic machines, and they began to lay plans
for a long-term computer program. However, by the end of the war they
had not been able to turn Bush\'s faith in microfilm into advanced and
reliable machines.

\~t\$f One important consequence of the absence of the ultra-fast
digital machines was that Hooper\'s dream of relying upon pure
statistical and mathematical cryptanalytical techniques had to be
deferred. Like England, the United States had to rely upon the most
expedient cryptanalytic as well as technological solutions. During 1942
and 1943, OP-20-G\'s \"M\" group was unable to become a think-tank for
pure methods. They and the cryptanalysts had to depend upon \"what
worked.\" And what worked in cryptanalysis were

brute force techniques that called upon massive data processing and
hunch playing. At the same time, the engineers at \"G\" and the Bureau
of Ships had to choose the easiest hardware solutions to meet the
demands of the hard-pressed codebreakers.

\(U) A series of increasingly complex and powerful devices began to
emerge in early 1944. But it was not until 1945 that OP-20-G\'s young
engineers could begin to think of creating a multipurpose Rapid Machine,
and when \"M\" could begin the exploration of the frontiers of
mathematical cryptology. There were more than technical reasons for the
gap between what Wenger and Hooper wanted and what was achieved during
the war. OP-20-G\'s World War II machine effort began in crisis, had to
respond to immediate cryptanalytic needs, and continued to be driven by
rapidly shifting demands.

\(U) January 1942: Too Much Too Late

\(U) Soon after Pearl Harbor, the bureau gained the funds to support all
the ideas that had been put forward by the various groups in OP-20G and
at the Navy Yard. Contracts were let to IBM for more tabulator equipment
and for the creation of a host of new special attachments. Those at the
bureau and OP-20-G who favored electromechanical equipment received
recognition when IBM was also awarded a very large contract to develop a
set of new machines to automate the processing of incoming data. At the
same time, a group of navy engineers in Washington was allowed to build
some electromechanical analysis machines of their own design.

\(U) The bureau had enough resources to prevent Bush\'s Comparator from
being locked away to die in the secret workroom at MIT. The bureau




IOP SfcCRETtiCOMINItiKfcL IU USA, AUb, LAN, bbK iM NZLMI

made an arrangement with Eastman-Kodak to work on all the microfilm and
plate ideas. This meant that Howard and his group were to be helpers not
supervisors for the teams Eastman hastily put to turning ideas into
machines.1 When Joseph Wenger returned and established the \"M\" group
under Howard Engstrom, he tried to regain control over the automatic
machines. But it took some time to organize \"M.\" In fact, if it had
not been for the crisis in the Atlantic and the attitude of Ralph
Meader, the man the bureau had assigned to supervise the machine
contracts, Wenger would not have been able to reassert OP20-G\'s power
over machine development.

\(U) In the first months of 1942, Meader ran a freewheeling one-man
operation for the bureau. Despite his freedom, he began to experience
the frustrations that had led Hooper and Bush to try to throw off the
heavy hands of the navy\'s bureaucracy in the 1930s. He came to feel
that the companies were unresponsive, and he compiled a list of
complaints.

certainly not a machine that was leading, as were the Bush designs, to
the use of digital circuits.

\(U) The machine was electrical, not electronic Eastman\'s team realized
that a pulse-based system, even with the plates, would be too complex.
Thus, an electric measuring system was built into the IC machine. There
was no counting, just a recognition that enough light had penetrated to
the photocell. The analyst would then tally the overlapped dots or find
their locations within a message.4

\(U) Although comparatively simple, the IC machines had deficiencies. It
was very difficult to coax the data camera to place the dots on the
plates in perfect alignment; that problem continued throughout the war.
The IC machines themselves had to be redesigned and reworked during
1943. Perhaps as many as one half of all the machines were inoperable at
any one moment.5

\(U) Haste and Conjiision

\(U) A Giant Step Backwards

\(U) When the bureau went to Eastman in early 1942, no one had expected
frightening delays or a need for radical redefinitions of \"G\'s\"
machines. Eastman\'s technical and managerial reputation pointed to a
speedy solution to the problems that had halted the work at the
Institute. Thus, it was natural for the bureau to turn to it when Howard
seemed to admit that he could not solve the problems of the proposed
microfilm Comparator. But Eastman would not meet the bureau\'s
expectations.

\(U) With help from John Howard\'s men, Eastman was able to ship the
first version of what became known as the Index of Coincidence Machine
before 1943.2 The IC Machine was a relatively simple plate-based device
that looked more like the early 1930s astronomers\' instruments than
Bush\'s Comparator.3 The IC Machine did its job, but it was not
automatic, and it was

\(U) Eastman\'s work began in haste, was not well supervised, and, as a
result, was not adequately documented. As a consequence, even the
military services were confused about the names of the machines Eastman
proposed or delivered before 1943.6 Some of the first lashed-together
models are only vaguely remembered. But the documents that remain
reflect the desperation to produce machines.

\(U) One of those was aversion of a Bush IC machine constructed during
1942. When it ran, it shook the entire laboratory; perhaps that is why
it never appeared in OP-20-G\'s machine center. The device did not use
the ideas for tape drives that Bush and Howard had explored. Rather, two
large message tapes were wound around a large hydraulically controlled
drum. As the drum spun at a very high speed, the tapes inched back and
offset themselves. When the photoelectric detector sensed a \"hit,\" the
drum slammed to a stop.7

-i\$i Some other alternative concepts for machines came from the groups
at Eastman as they searched for ways to make Howard\'s original
suggestions turn into hardware. Trying to help the navy in its attack
against the very stubborn Japanese additive code systems, the Eastman
engineers drew up initial plans for a combination of tape readers,
electronic circuits to strip the additives, and a set of whirling disks
that were to hold frequently used code groups. An Edgerton flash lamp
was to help to see if the stripped text groups matched one of the codes
on the disks.8

(S//SI) The disk contraption was not delivered to the navy, but
Eastman\'s initial attempt to turn Bush\'s Rapid Document \"Selector\"
(Information Machine) ideas into a useful military machine arrived in
Washington before the end of 1942. Tessie was Eastman\'s first great
contribution. Tessie began as an attempt to finally turn the
architecture and the fundamental technologies of the microfilm Selector
into a machine that worked. But Tessie became another pragmatic
compromise. Bush\'s ideas were too difficult to put into practice. They
could not be changed into hardware quickly enough to meet the pressing
cryptanalytic needs of the first years of the war.

\(U) Tessie Wouldn\'t Either

■fS}\"John Howard made sure that Eastman knew what he wanted well before
the formal contracts with the Bureau of Ships were signed. He told the
men in Rochester that in order to deliver something of value, in what
was hoped was a reasonable time, the new military \"Selector\" was to be
a special purpose device to perform an important but minimally
challenging cryptanalytic function. Its job was to locate four-character
code groups (tetragraphs), not to count them. Finding and giving the
location of groups was a \"quick and dirty\" version of IC analysis.
\"Locations\" pointed to the possibility that two messages were in
\"depth.\" 9

\(S) Tessie\'s logic and architecture were like those of a Selector
rather than a Comparator. It used two 35-millimeter films. One sped past
an optical reading station while the other remained stationary and acted
as an identification mask. After the fast film made a complete
revolution, the mask film was stepped one frame. If a desired tetragraph
was located, a signal was emitted. Then, a strobe circuit signaled a
high-power Edgerton flash to send light through the identification
portions of the two data films. The light would register the location of
a matched group. After the run was completed, the new film was to be
quickly developed, then sent to the analysts who would trace the groups
and begin their attempt to break the codes.10 There was no ability to
reproduce the code groups, and there was no ability totally. Those
features, Howard knew, would ask too much ofthe engineers working under
pressure - even of Eastman\'s experts.11

\(U) The Eastman group put in a great deal of overtime and was able to
send a machine to Washington in September 1942. RAM-2, or Tessie I, was
a large and ungainly thing that was more than six feet long and almost
as high. On one end was the drive mechanism for the data microfilms. On
the other was a huge round canister-like component that housed some
ofthe electronics and the photographic reproduction equipment. On top
ofthe canister was a rack of tubes that could not be squeezed into the
machine\'s frame.12

-\^Although ugly, Tessie raised expectations about the Eastman portion
ofthe RAM program. A great deal of equipment was ordered to support
Tessie\'s work. Fifty- and sixty-foot metal developing trays, film
drying racks, and hundreds of pounds of chemicals began arriving at the
cramped \"G\" headquarters.13

-(&)- Tessie failed, however. In its first runs it missed almost all the
coincident tetragraphs. When it did find a \"hit,\" it refused to
produce the record of it on its internal film. The Edgerton

1943 to replace many of the circuits and to design a new flash system.
The machine did begin to do a bit of work. It was put to use in an
attempt by the Americans to attack the Enigma by searching for
tetragraphic repeats.16 Tessie proved of some use in the next few months
although it continued to misbehave. Because of continued problems, it
was replaced as soon as possible and changed into an even greater analog

type flash system would not function. Even the Washington, D.C., water
supply refused to cooperate in the film development process of the two
\"data\" films. Chemical imbalances in the water were making the tiny
dots the Tessie light bank data camera produced spill over onto each
other, making recognition impossible. That added to the difficulties of
making the camera light bank behave. Some of the problems with the
camera were fixed, but it took longer to find a way to compensate for
the chemistry of the District\'s water supply.14

-fT8\> One of Tessie\'s weaknesses was very embarrassing for the
engineers. It missed \"hits\" that were too close together. The special
warning circuit Howard and his men had devised to solve the problem
would not behave.15

(SJThroughout fall 1942 Tessie was too unreliable to be used as an
operational machine. Finally, it was decided to make a major investment
in its repair. It took Larry Steinhardt and his crew in Washington
almost all of January

\(U) Tessie\'s New Hat

€¥S}-The navy\'s Tessie was turned into a machine to perform a very
simple type of search for \"isomorphs.\" Asa result, the new Tessie used
only a few ideas from Bush\'s 1930s proposal for a navy \"Symmetrical
Sequence\" engine. In its new life, it no longer reproduced hit
locations on film. The flash camera was abandoned in favor of a punch.18

(TS//8I) Codebreakers search for anything that is nonrandom. When they
can find patterns that are obviously not produced by chance alone, they
have at least a beginning of an attack on an enemy system. Repeats of
phrases or even words are one of the signals that additional analysis
might lead to a successful understanding of an enemy\'s cipher. One of
the ways cryptanalysts located repeated messages, or repeated groups
within messages, was to search for what the army called \"isomorphs\"
and the navy called \"symmetric sequences

»19

CCS//SI) Because cipher machines or additive systems are designed to
hide repeats of words, looking for exact matches in small amounts of
text is usually a waste of time. But what may be





found are patterns. If the word \"BATTLE\" is treated as a sequence of
letters and recorded as \"ABCCDE,\" an analyst may search for a repeat
of the pattern. The pattern may appear despite the ability of additives
to disguise the underlying code group.

(TS//SI) Isomorphic attacks are expensive \"long-shots.\" They were
time-consuming because of the need to recode message texts, and
identifying an isomorph only led to a probability that a depth had been
found. But the method had proven of value to the American cryptanalysts
since at least the 1930s.

-£FS\> When the first Eastman Tessie was outclassed as a locator of
exact match, four-character groups by its replacement, Icky, OP-20-G
decided to have Tessie turned into an emergency Symmetric Sequence
Machine. What emerged from the workshops in early 1944 became known as
Tessie SS. The reborn Tessie was still a six-byseven-foot monster, but
it had been stripped of many of its most sophisticated components.
However, it finally worked, and it saved a great deal of analyst and, as
important, recoding time.20

mechanism like the ones built for the paper tape Comparator. When the
photocell spotted a repeated letter, it ordered the two tapes to be
punched with tiny holes. When the entire sixcharacter-per-second run
through the message was completed, the paper tapes were removed, placed
on a viewer, and searched for patterns of red dots that would indicate
where an isomorph had been found. Tessie SS was much less elegant than
the original, but it functioned successfully.

\(U) You Can Use Some ojthe Technology Some of the Time, But\...

\(U) Soon after the original Tessie was delivered to Washington in fall
1942, it was realized that it would never be a success. A radical
redesign would be necessary. Avery different design was needed if the
navy was to have a successful high-speed microfilm machine.

\(U) Eastman assigned a new crew to the task in early 1943, but the
company was unable to deliver a machine, Icky, until October 1943. Then
it took another few months for the men in Rochester to develop an
efficient camera to produce reliable microfilms for the new Icky.

(T9//3I) The new Tessie had a small reel for the 35mm message film and
one for a mask that contained patterns for the letters A to Z. The
photoelectric scanning system\'s first task was to identify the first
character of text on the film. Then, it scanned twenty characters of the
message as the alphabetic mask film sped by. If it found a repeat of the
first of the twenty characters, it signaled that the other half of the
machine should get to work.

(TS//SI) At the other end of Tessie SSwas that original huge round
canister. But now it contained a roll of plain 70mm paper tape and a
roll of the black-red tape that Bush had used on his paper tape
Comparator, not unexposed film. Instead of the strobe system for
reproducing the location codes for a hit, there was a punching

-£E8tAsthey were designing abetter camera system, the Eastman group
received some more depressing news. After its first rounds of tests in
Washington, Icky needed to be reworked. It had to be shipped back to
Rochester because of the great amount of repair and redesign that was
needed.21 On its return to Washington, the machine became an important
tool for OP-20-G; but its success depended on its being, in some ways,
another retrogression.

(TS//SI) First, to allow it to be of immediate and reliable use, it had
been designed to be much more limited than the Comparator or even
Tessie.512 Icky was a film version of the IC plate machine, and it was
able to do a primitive analog ICtest, but it just located. It did not
make copies or count. It had no reproducing cameras and it

had no counter-printer. When enough light was registered, the machine
lit a signal lamp and stopped. Its operator used a hand crank to turn
the films back towards the identified coincidence. At the point where
\"enough\" light came through the two films another signal lamp was lit.
Then the operator used a screen to read the location marks printed on
the margins of the films.

\(U) From its beginnings as a bench model, Icky evolved into a chest-high
box as wide as a refrigerator. On its top was a screen to view the
located messages. Next to the screen were the reels and rollers for two
35mm microfilms. Underneath were the mechanisms that sped one of the
films past the other and the ratchets that stepped the index film after
each pass of the fast tape. Icky\'s optical sensing gate was designed to
allow the location of message patterns of up to thirty columns of data.
Typically, a bright light was pointed through masks and lenses which
segregated the light into thirty parallel columns. Iflight penetrated
films, it was directed to thirty small which then sent the light beam to
their photocells.

\(U) The light management portion of the machine was complex and demanded
perfect alignments. It was the demands of that photocell system that led
to Icky\'s having only forty columns of data per inch of film, a density
far less than Bush had promised the navy.

\(U) More significant, Icky was not a digital machine. Like OP-20-G\'s
other World War II microfilm devices, it wandered back to the use of
analog circuits. But it did have a plugboard and resistor matrix system
that allowed the selection of many different combinations of
coincidences. Polygraphs of long lengths, or patterns ofidenti

the two mirrors,

cal subgroups, or single-letter coincidences could be identified.

\(U) Icky had another feature that went beyond the original Selector. Its
coding system could be changed and its circuits switched so that it
responded to the absence of light rather than its presence.23 The
navy\'s men found the blackout method much more efficient when the job
was to search for coincident areas (such as code groups) rather than
single columns of data. With its use, they could pack more than one
letter in a column. They could register a five-letter (or number)
message group.

\(U) In the blackout system, the two tapes were reciprocally coded so
that a matched column would admit no light. Atwo-of-five character





code allowed the use of that reciprocal scheme, but Ick/s scanner could
also accommodate Bush\'s older one-of-twenty-six pattern.24

\(U) A Machine for Mrs. Driscoll\'s Special Problem

\(U) Eastman designed and built another of the very few types of
microfilm machines used by OP-20-G during the war. The Hypo assignment
came in a rush, and, like Tessie, it took a year to complete.25 The
first Hypo was not in operation until October 1943.26

\(U) The name, Hypo, came from the \"Hypothetical Machine\" proposal
drawn up in response to the early requests by Mrs. Driscoll\'s Enigma
group.27 The project languished for a time, but ideas were formalized in
March 1942. Machine design began six months later.28 Hypo\'s task was to
help Driscoll\'s small team make a traditional attack on the German
Enigma. It was the first machine designed especially for the American
work against the \"E\" machine.

(T3//SI) In early 1942, the United States had hopes of cracking the
Enigma in the same way it had broken earlier Japanese cipher machines
--- through methods that included what some called \"statistical\"
analysis. Once the entire wheel wiring of \"E\" became known, it was
hoped that large files (catalogs) could be constructed showing how each
combination of enciphering wheels would \"develop\" high frequency
letters, digraphs, or very common words. This \"catalog\" approach was
not considered a \"cribbing\" attack; it was seen at the time as a
statistical method although counting was not required.29

fT0//S9- Constructing catalogs was very laborious. There had to be a
card for each wheel combination and order, and for each position of the
wheels. Such catalogs ran to hundreds of thousands of cards. Some filled
an entire wall with file drawers. When put into book form, the heavy
volumes demanded along set of shelves.

ff\$//SI) Searching through all the entries to find those indicating
which wheel settings might have produced the enciphered text was also
very labor intensive.30 That was why cryptanalysts around the world
turned to the use of overlay sheets. They allowed a speedier and less
demanding way of identifying the possible settings of the enciphering
machines.31 But they were limited and everyone wanted a faster method.

(T9//SI) Investing in the construction of catalogs seemed very wise in
1942 because the United States did not have Bombes or the capability to
continuously find the long and trustworthy cribs that made the British
Bombes so powerful. The Americans did not even have the command of the
techniques that had allowed Alan Turing to apply his indicator- (not
crib-) based Banburismus IC-like system to \"E\" since the late

1930s

32

(TS//SI) The Americans knew that Hypo would not be a cure-all machine,
but they had little else to rely upon. The enormous amount of labor
required to prepare Hypo\'s \"database,\" the catalog, seemed
worthwhile. Turning the catalog into a form that could be used by a
high-speed machine meant creating a separate roll of film for each wheel
combination. One was needed for each combination of the Enigma\'s slow
and medium wheels and its reflector. Each frame on a film recorded the
output of high frequency letters for a wheel position. A minimum set of
the master films was fifty-six, each with over 17,000 frames.33

£KS//St) The preparation of the message film involved as much
cryptanalytic persistence as did creating the \"catalog\" films. In one
of the most common uses of Hypo, ciphertext was partially deciphered by
pulling out the influence of the presumed stecker and fast wheel.34
Then, the new text was put through a crude Letterwriter tape machine
that recorded the text as tiny dots on microfilm. After that, an analyst
had to wait the many minutes while the film was developed,

dried, and checked for possible defects. Producing the message film grew
so burdensome that IBM and Eastman were ordered to cooperate to build a
very expensive but labor saving card-tofilm camera system for Hypo.35

\(U) The Americans were so desperate for their own solution to the Enigma
problem in 1942 that they did not want to admit to the limitations of
the Hypo method. Hypo was not powerful. A Hypo run needed prior
knowledge of the stecker, reflector, and wheel order used for an \"E\"
message. With that information it could point out a \"likely\" starting
position (window setting) for the Enigma wheels.36 That was all it could
do, and that was why only two Hypos were built by Eastman during the
war.37 Although OP-20-G\'s leaders might have envisioned rooms full of
Hypos, each running a catalog film against a message, they soon came to
treat the Eastman machine as only an adjunct to the Bombes.38

\(U) Hypo looked and behaved much like Icky. It used two 35mm films. It
was based on dot cod

ing and the light bank data entry system.39 The Hypo camera (for dot
registration) was an improvement over Icky\'s, however. Data cards or
tapes signaled which one of the lights in each column would be lit, and
the tiny dots were recorded on the films with great precision.

\(U) The men working on Hypo also conquered some of the problems of the
film stepping mechanisms. That allowed a more precise and speedy
comparison of the films. When the catalog and message films were placed
on the machine, one was held stationary while the other flashed by it.
As in Tessie and Icky, when the second film completed a revolution, the
first was stepped one increment. That took less than five seconds.

\(U) The \"statistical\" test in Hypo was a desired level of coincidence
between text and master film spots. As in Tessie, Hypo\'s photocells
monitored a zone rather than an individual column. The likely
enciphering-wheel positions were identified simply by enough light
reaching a photocell. When the machine stopped, its operator wrote down
the location of the hit.

\(U) Hypo was an analog machine designed to locate. It was not coaxed to
tally until the end of the war. Even then, it remained a very simple
device. Despite that, Hypo proved as useful as Tessie did, though
neither machine solved any systems by itself. Copies of Hypo were
supplied to the army\'s cryptanalysts, and a second and more complex
version was constructed for OP-20-G later in the war. By early 1945,
Hypo was also being used against Japanese systems, after it had
undergone some significant modifications. 4°

\(U) A Paper War, Perlmps

\(U) Hypo did not seem a winner in 1943, however. The delays in
delivering Icky and Hypo had made Meader and Wenger fearful that Eastman
would be unable to produce any device except the crude analog and plate
IC Machine. Tn the critical first two years of the war, they also feared
that IBM would not deliver its promised data conversion machines. In
addition, there were signs that the next model of the Bush Comparator
was in serious trouble. At the beginning of the war, OP20-G was hedging
all its technological bets. Although Howard had advised against a paper
tape machine, the navy ordered him to stop his exploration of microfilm
and draw up the essentials of an upgraded paper tape Bush Comparator.
Howard helped draft a sketch of a slightly revised version of the old
Comparator and sent it to the bureau\'s contractors, NCR and Gray
Electric.41 NCR and Gray set out with a great deal of enthusiasm, and
the navy looked forward to a third version of the Comparator in a few
months.

\(U) Using the older 70-millimeter paper tape, but with room for
thirty-two rather than twentysix characters, the new Comparator tallied
and it employed parallelism. It was able to handle and record up to five
pattern tests at once. Its circuits and plugboards were more complex
than the earlier model, and it was given an important new capability: it
could locate. One tape could be held stationary while the other sped
past it. The stationary tape then moved one increment for another pass
of the second tape, stopping when a match was sensed.

\(U) Four copies of the new paper tape Comparators were constructed
between 1943 and 1945.42 They seemed so promising when they were first
designed that Britain asked for two. Later, its codebreakers decided
against the machines, and the two were sent to the army\'s men at
Arlington Hall.43

\(U) The World War II paper tape. Comparator proved an essential tool for
the jobs that needed tallying, but, unfortunately, the new machines
could not be convinced to run appreciably faster than the 1938
Comparator. The 1943-1945 models continued to have a relatively slow
speed, eighty-five characters a second.

\(U) One irksome feature of the Comparators was corrected by the end of
the war. Like the original Bush Comparator, the 1943 device printed
every result, appreciably slowing its performance. To speed it, an
electronic circuit was added that allowed printing only when a highly
improbable level of coincidence was computed.44

\(U) The task of making a reliable punch was probably turned over to a
Bass River, Massachusetts, firm. But even an expert private manufacturer
could not overcome the punch\'s difficulties. The Oano Company had a
tough time with the design and soon separated itself from the Comparator
project.45

\(U) By late 1942, the Comparator seemed destined to fail again. There
was too much for Meader and Howard to keep under control.

\(U) The Comparator Dies, Again

\(U) John Howard spent the first months of 1942 traveling from place to
place with Ralph Meader trying to force progress on the Eastman and
NCR-Gray machines. By mid-1942 Meader and Wenger sensed that something
was wrong with the Gray-NCR-MIT effort. When all the components were
finally delivered to Washington, they did not fit together. The
situation was so bad that the Comparator was returned to New York where
the Gray and navy engineers redid most of its parts.

\(U) When the Comparator was finally sent back to Washington, the navy
engineers had to spend a great deal more of their valuable time





reworking the comparing and counter-printer units. That further delayed
putting it to use.46

\(U) The new Comparator did not go into operation until November 1943.47

\(U) By then, the relations between Gray and OP-20-G had become quite
tense. What the navy interpreted as disorganization in New York had much
to do with its alienation.

\(U) One explanation of why only four copies of the new Comparator were
built is the difficulty \"G\" had controlling Gray\'s work. The lack of
control became quite evident in mid-1944 when Gray Manufacturing took
out a full-page advertisement in a widely read electronics journal. It
showed the world what kind of tasks Gray had been doing for the
government that had earned it an Army-Navy E award. The bottom third of
the advertisement caused an emotional outburst in Washington. The last
two items on the page stated:48

(I I) \< Optical work including the design and construction of various
units in the projection field including photographic technique, motion
picture, and optical systems involving condensers, prisms, and
associated reflector equipment\... communication equipment, electrical
counting and calculating devices, including communications devices for
producing or operating from perforated, inked, and ended tapes of
various kinds.

\(U) The advertisement infuriated the crew at OP-20-G. On top of all the
manufacturing problems, Gray had endangered the security of \"G\'s\" RAM
program. Larry Steinhardt could not contain himself when he read the
advertisement. He tore it out of the journal and immediately sent it to
Howard Engstrom with a message he wrote on it that said, \"Note below an
excellent description of the 70mm junkpile this outfit built. Please
pass to Meader.\" Although the way the contractors had organized their
work had much to do with the

Comparator\'s problems, the underlying cause of all of the difficulties
was stubborn technologies. They made it impossible for the nation\'s
best engineers to fulfill Bush\'s promises.

\(U) The machines built between late 1943 and the end of the war had to
be retreats from Bush\'s visions. The Copperheads, for example, had to
be compromises between an engineer\'s pride and cryptanalytic needs.
Other machines, such as Bulldozer and Duenna, were advances on the state
of the electronic art, but they were based on ideas and techniques that
were very different from those Bush had championed.

\(V) Almost Another Digital Machine

\(U) The other major attempt by the navy\'s team to fulfill Bush\'s
promises was the Copperhead series.49 Several different Copperheads were
designed, and five copies of one of the series were built under Lawrence
Steinhardt\'s direction at National Cash Register and at \"M\'s\"
Washington engineering laboratory. Constatction began in late 1943.
Unfortunately, all of the more ambitious plans for the Copperheads had
to be put aside because of technical problems and cryptologic
emergencies. Only the copies of the rather simple Copperhead I were
built.

\(U) In 1943 the Atiantic crisis eased somewhat, giving \"M\" a bit of
time to turn to Japanese problems. Lawrence Steinhardt was assigned the
job of designing Rapid Machines to attack additive systems. Additive
systems were codes with random numbers added or subtracted from the
underlying numeric codes. Among many others, the major Japanese naval
codes used additives. The fleet operational code, JN25, was of very
special importance to American intelligence. But it had proven to be a
very difficult adversary, especially because the Japanese frequentiy
changed the long list of additives used to superencipher its messages.





\(U) Discovering those additives was a tedious process. \"G\" had to call
on many different methods of attack. IBM equipment had been modified to
speed the identification of the superencipherments, but the process
remained very slow and seemed in need of Rapid Machines. In 1943 it was
decided to start an additive RAM program. Following the new habit of
using the names of snakes for Japanese problems, the project was called
Copperhead.

\(U) Still excited about opticalelectronics, Steinhardt prepared the
outlines for at least five different devices for the Copperhead
problems. In his plans, the more complex models were to be able to add
and subtract and to test statistical weights at electronic speeds.

(T0//CI) Copperhead II, for example, was designed to be able to add
clusters of additives to message text, then compare the results against
along list of known high-frequency code groups.

\^-Copperhead V was a truly grand vision. If it had been built, it would
have been twenty feet square. It would have had to have been that big to
be able to match strings of additives against cipher text, then perform
a true statistical test for nonrandom letter frequencies.50 That called
for sophisticated electronics and very high-speed input. The complex job
assigned to \"V\" seemed to call for microfilm for input and perhaps for
a vast memory. But Steinhardt was aware of the problems at Eastman, and
at the onset of the Copperhead project he decided that the older punch
tape approach would be best.

\(U) More than a year was spent searching for a new tape and designing a
revolutionary punch.

::: {style="width: 48.21638573108585%;"}
:::

After testing many materials, including aluminum foil, a 70mm opaque
polystyrene tape was selected. It had the stability needed for very
highspeed transport past the scanning station and did not distort when
there were humidity changes. Of great importance, it could accommodate a
data density about twice that of the Comparator\'s paper tapes.

\(U) The Copperhead punch was a major engineering feat. Its main cabinet
was over six feet tall and was wider than a phone booth. It was packed
with delicate mechanical and electronic parts that perfectly aligned two
tapes and then punched a reciprocal code. Each column on the tape had
room for twenty-five tiny dots for message characters and several others
for identification of the message. The punch was designed around the
blackout system. Learning from earlier microfilm explorations that the
absence of light was easier





to monitor than its presence, one tape was punched to be the complement
of the two-of-five code on the other. The designers were so pleased with
the Copperhead\'s punch, they built modified versions of it for the
older Gray-NCR Comparators.

\(U) Copperhead I used two sets of sophisticated motor-driven reels. It
had a sensor system to manage the end-of-tape condition and the
mechanical components needed to automatically rewind and step the tapes.
Also, the machine was a landmark in optical sensing. It was built to
scan one hundred message columns at a time!

(TJ) As with Icky, the Copperhead team had to take some significant
backward steps to produce a machine to meet the war crises. Only one
version of the Copperheads was built, and it was unable to count; it
simply located message groups. As many as five of the Copperhead I
machines were constructed and in operation by the opening of 1945. But
they were very limited punched tape versions of the IC Machine and Icky.

\(V) The Old Technologies Are the Best Technologies, for a Time

\(U) In the spring of 1942, the Copperheads were not yet well-formed
ideas, and all other Rapid Machines were in trouble. Even the
refurbished 1938 Comparator, the only working Rapid machine, was not
proving its worth. Lawrence Steinhardt had to strip it of many of its
original functions to make it reliable enough for use in mid-1942.

4S\* By October, Steinhardt had built a crude prototype and had drawn
the outlines for a much more sophisticated machine to identify Japanese
code groups based on frequency criteria.

■48) For the emergency machine, 700 of the most frequent groups were
stored on film in descending order of frequency. The meaning of

the group and its known relative frequency were listed next to the
group\'s number and language equivalent. The \"selector\" was a simple
relay store with \"pin\" settings indicating the frequency of the
various code groups in the message being analyzed. When the message
group and its frequency matched the composition of a group on the memory
film, the film\'s entry was recorded by a fastflash system. After the
run, the new film was developed and sent to an analyst who used the
information to help decrypt the message.31

(TS//SI) After the first lash-up came a series of increasingly complex
\"Full Selectors.\" By the end of 1942, the first model had been
modified through the addition of more sophisticated relay boxes; and by
that time there were plans for a much larger and powerful device,
Mercury.

(TS//8I) Although the hopes for a huge electronic version were defeated,
Mercury became a room full of relay racks that performed a sophisticated
\"weighted dictionary look-up\" test to identify code groups.52
Unfortunately for the navy, Mercury was not working until the summer of
1945

\(U) Meanwhile, the Tabulator\'s Revenge

\(U) While Wenger worried about the absence offunctioning Rapid Machines,
those who had advocated the development of older technologies seemed to
be vindicated. The old timers were in charge of tabulator development,
and in 1942 they were the ones delivering cryptanalytic results.53

\(U) IBM sent all the tabulators and sorters and collators OP-20-G could
make room for, and the company began to create a host of very powerful
additions for its machines. After \"G\" moved to its new quarters at an
elegant girls\' school on Nebraska Avenue and had adequate space, OP20-G
became one ofthe world\'s largest users of TBM equipment. \"G\'s\" TBM
machines were count


jpp cEPBtTiirflyiiiTTinri Tnini mi r,uu i.mj inumu;i))«l



edin the hundreds, and they used millions of punch cards a week.54

\(U) Acquiring standard IBM machines was relatively easy. Alone among
almost all business machine manufacturers, IBM had been permitted to
continue manufacturing its products during the war. Its \"tabs\"
remained stock items, and OP20-G already had high priority status.

\(U) But gaining IBM\'s commitment to continue to alter its machines (or
to allow OP-20-G to do so) proved more difficult. Joseph Wenger had to
make a personal visit to Tom Watson to convince him to grant OP-20-G\'s
requests special attention. By the end of the war, IBM and the armed
services\' engineers, many of whom were drafted from IBM and were sent
directly to Washington, had created modifications that allowed the
electromechanical machines to perform all the cryptanalytic functions.
Because of those modifications, IBM\'s equipment remained the foundation
ofOP-20-G\'s operations throughout the war.

20-G/Yard crew did not demand the creation of an all-purpose tabulator
or a general-purpose relay computer, but they asked for some challenging
engineering advances. The requests indicate the old-timers had long had
their own alternatives to Bush\'s mid-i930s Rapid Machine proposals.

\(U) As well as the special electromechanical attachments for OP-20-G\'s
tabulators, IBM created ambitious relay additions. The new IBM devices
were better able to identify and tally particular code groups and to
search for repetitions of character patterns. Among the more ambitious
proposals for IBM equipment were the Navy Change (NC) machines.

\(U) The NC machines were more than standard tabs with a few additions
hung on them. Some of the thirteen types of Navy Change machines came
close to being special relay computers. Others had special high-speed
electromechanical accumulators and some had electronic tubes.57

\(U) With the outbreak of war, the tabulator group at \"G\" was able to
expand and to convince IBM to produce specialized equipment. IBM and the
navy began a cooperative effort that lasted throughout the war.55 A
number of IBM men went to Washington, and a host of new attachments were
developed. Some allowed more efficient additive stripping. New devices
provided more effective multiple key sorting and the offset and
comparison of messages for IC analysis. The location of code words was
made faster by other additions to the tabulators, sorters, and punches.

\(U) Although IBM played an important role in OP-20-G\'s war, it was not
asked to take a significant part in the Rapid Machine program.56 One
reason for not calling on IBM was that OP-20-G was already asking a
great deal of the company. In 1942 the requests by the tab group at\"G\"
for electromechanical and relay devices were enough to keep the
company\'s best men busy. The OP

\(U) IBM\'s Most Special Contribution

\(U) During 1941 and early 1942, before Engstrom\'s group gained real
power over machine development, and as the Eastman and Gray-NCR projects
were faltering, IBM and the men at\"G\" created another innovative
system, the Letterwriters. Those devices brought OP-20G\'s data handling
into the modern era because they linked teletype, tape, card, and film
media. The Letterwriter system tied special electric typewriters to
automatic tape and card punches and eventually to film processing
machines.

\(U) Before the war the radio intercept personnel wrote out the messages
they heard on forms, then forwarded them by mail or keyed them as
telegrams. Because OP-20-G had just begun to develop teletype and radio
networks, it took




■ICJP SKlKEIXtOMINDmftL IU USA, AUS, IAN, GBR WW NZU)AI

weeks to send all but the most vital messages from the Pacific.58

\(U) There are somewhat conflicting stories about the origins of the
Letterwriter (CXCO) equipment, perhaps because its prehistory was linked
to so many different groups within the navy. The timing is not entirely
clear, but sometime in late 1940 Hooper\'s previous connections to the
man who had sold his advanced electric typewriter business to IBM led to
some interest in perhaps modifying his machines to turn them into data
processing devices.

\(U) The interest was turned into action in early 1942 when a young IBM
engineer entered the navy and was assigned toOP-20-G. John Skinner had
worked on a special typewriter-teletype project at IBM. When he had
enough experience to appreciate \"G\'s\" data processing problems, he
contacted his ex-boss and arranged to have some equipment shipped to
Washington.59 After IBM engineers arrived with the devices and
demonstrated their potential, there was an immediate request that IBM
launch a major project.

Within less than a year, the first production Letterwriter devices were
delivered to the cryptanalysts.

\(U) The timely appearance of the first machines was a result of IBM\'s
earlier commercial efforts at its Electromatic division.60 The system
centered on a special electric typewriter, a tape punch, and a tape
reader. It was hoped they would eventually allow the creation of
machineready data directly from \"G\'s\" new international telegraph
system.

\(U) The Letterwriters were not intended to be analysis machines, but to
fill the gap left by the delayed RAM program. The engineers in
Washington turned the Writers into much more than data entry devices. By
adding simple plugboards, the engineers made the machines produce
worksheets for the cryptanalysts and change one code into another.61 By
1942 the Letterwriters were evolving into machines for analysis. First,
the typewriters were modified to allow the printing of more
sophisticated worksheets. Flugboxes were added which allowed complex
substitutions

::: {style="width: 72.67738141905136%;"}
:::





of one character for another. This helped determine the settings of the
letter-changing plugboards on encryption machines. In addition to being
useful for the analysis of steckering, the modified Letterwriters helped
to strip cipher wheel patterns from messages.

\(U) Simple changes made the Letterwriter equipment useful for another
very important but time-consuming task, the analysis of wheel settings.
When an analyst thought he had found the correct combinations on an
enemy system, he would set up a copy of the encryption machine\'s
wheels, lugs, and plugboards and type in parts of the encrypted message.
He then examined the output to see if it was sensible. By coupling a
Letterwriter tape-reader to one of the American copies of a foreign
cipher machine, an analyst would not have to repeatedly enter a message
through the machine\'s keyboard.

\(U) In the Absence of Rapid Machines

\(U) The delays in the delivery of the Rapid Machines led to another use
for the Letterwriters. The Yard\'s men decided to build more
far-reaching extensions of them. The first of their 1942 creations was a
frequency counter. Aptly titled The Simple Frequency Counter, it was
among the first of the new machines to be delivered to OP-20G. The
Simple Counter and its descendants had a power Bush\'s machines did not
possess: they were able to recognize and record individual letters. The
recognition, counting, and recording of particular letters and
polygraphs demanded too many complex elec

tronic circuits and parts for computer technology of the early 1940s.

\(U) The Counter saved preparing IBM card decks and the many steps
involved in repeated sorting. It was such an effective design that in
1943 a grand extension of the Counter was constructed at NCR. The NCR
machine, Mike, tallied digraphs. Despite the low speed of such devices
as Mike, the inability to deliver any Rapid Machines led the Yard\'s men
to create yet another type of relay-electromechanical analyzer. They
designed a machine, Mathew,62 to perform additive stripping. Like the
Counter, the Mathews proved reliable and were used throughout the war.
Mathew was so rugged that it was applied to more than traditional
stripping.63 It was used on such jobs as removing the influence of a
cipher wheel from an encrypted message. Over the years, the many Mathews
(at least four were constructed) proved useful against a majority of the
encryption systems attacked byOP-20-G. Mathew was not a general-purpose
machine, however, and its technology dated from the 1920s. Its
processing power was limited by the speed of its tape readers and its
typewriter. But it was able to perform faster than the tabulators and to
fulfill functions too complex for the electronic Rapid Machines of the
era.

vary from six to as many as twenty-eight. Four is the correct figure.
The reason for the high estimate was probably that all the later postwar

types of NC machines were

NC 1: consecutive numbering device

C2: relay adder to mechanize decryption of additive cipher

NC3: \"single eliminator,\" which selected duplicate cards in a deck
leaving only unique ones; it used vacuum tube circuits and read 300
cards a minute (NC 12 replaced it).

NC4: selective punch whose relay additions allowed a variety of
substitutions to be punched on

C3.IX1S

NC5: pattern punch whose abilities included searching for isomorphs

NC6: column differencer whose amazing accumulator could hold up to 400
items, recognize the largest, and punch an indicating card. It also
matched high frequency text against stripped code

NC7: percentage selector whose special relay box allowed round-robin
repeat searches and selected them on a percentage of coincidence basis

NC8: automatic circuit changer, which allowed automatic switching of
alpha or numeric data among as many as twenty-five plugboards and the
rearrangement columnar data

NC9: only a prototype of this special substitution punch was built.

NC10 and NC11: typewriter-like near off-the-shelf devices

NC12: replaced the NC3

conversion from microfilm to cards was a true innovation at the time
